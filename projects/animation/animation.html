    <h1>Basic :hovers and transitions</h1>

    <p>1. In order to have a <span>:hover</span> transition applied, you need to write two separate lines of code inside your CSS.</p>

    <p>2. The first is to apply a <span> :hover</span> on the element or class</p>

    <p class="text-change">3. For example, when you hover over this paragraph the background-color changes. Notice that this change here is instant and there's no delay.</p>

    <p class="slow">4. To have a change in the duration of how it appears, you need to apply a <span>transition</span> property inside the css of the class you want to affect. This is written as <br><span class="transition"> transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];</span><br> In this example since there are multiple items changing, <span>all</span> is used for the transition property</p>

    <p class="pos-change">5. In order to have the position change, you would change the x or y position using <span>transform:translateX(____)</span></p>

    <div class="bd">
        <p class="op-change">6. You can also use opacity to have elements fade in or out slowly using opacity</p>
    </div>

    <p>Tasks</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a transition duration of 3 seconds to the 3rd paragraph</li>
        <li>Add a :hover and transition to affect all of the spans to reverse the color - black to pink</li>
        <li>Have the 5th paragraph move vertically</li>
        <li>Fade out the border around the 6th paragraph when it is hovered</li>
        

    </ul>
