<p1 class="cursortwo">Yesterday</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
<p6 class="cursorone">All my troubles seemed so far away</p6>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Now it looks as though they're here to stay</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Oh, I believe in yesterday</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p1 class="cursortwo">Suddenly</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
<p6 class="cursorone">I'm not half the man I used to be</p6>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>There's a shadow hangin' over me</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Oh, yesterday came suddenly</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p1 class="cursortwo">Yesterday</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
<p6 class="cursorone">Love was such an easy game to play</p6>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Now I need a place to hide away</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Oh, I believe in yesterday</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p1 class="cursortwo">Yesterday</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
<p6 class="cursorone">Love was such an easy game to play</p6>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Now I need a place to hide away</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p2>Oh, I believe in yesterday</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
<p1>Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm</p1>
